Project Context: AniGame Flutter App

Purpose: To maintain a running log of development progress, key decisions, and next steps for the AniGame project.

Key Files We've Been Modifying/Reviewing:
------------------------------------------
- c:\My Installs\projects\anigame\lib\game_state.dart: Core game logic, card operations (leveling, evolution, ascension), currency, battle system, raid events, saving/loading state with Firestore.
- c:\My Installs\projects\anigame\lib\screens\card_detail_screen.dart: UI for displaying card details and initiating actions like leveling, evolution, and ascension. This is where we were last debugging a layout issue.
- c:\My Installs\projects\anigame\lib\utils\dev_admin_tools.dart: Tools for developers/admins to add currency, shards, and cards to user accounts.
- c:\My Installs\projects\anigame\lib\data\card_definitions.dart: Contains the base templates for all cards in the game.
- c:\My Installs\projects\anigame\lib\utils\leveling_cost_util.dart: Utility for calculating costs for card leveling.
- c:\My Installs\projects\anigame\lib\card_model.dart: Defines the `Card` class and related enums like `CardRarity`, `CardType`, `ShardType`.

Main Features/Logic Discussed & Implemented/Modified:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Card Leveling:
   - Direct upgrade using gold and elemental shards (or souls as a substitute for shards).
   - Enhancement using XP from fodder cards or souls.

2. Card Evolution:
   - Sequential: Evo 0 + Evo 0 sacrifice -> Evo 1; Evo 1 + Evo 1 sacrifice -> Evo 2; Evo 2 + Evo 2 sacrifice -> Evo 3.
   - Requires max level card and max level duplicate sacrifice of the same evolution stage.
   - Costs elemental shards (or souls).
   - Resets card to Level 1, boosts stats based on new evolution tier.

3. Card Ascension (Post-Evo 3):
   - Requires an Evo 3, max level card.
   - Sacrifice material: One Evo 0 duplicate of the same card (level of sacrifice doesn't matter).
   - Costs elemental shards (or souls), cost increases with ascension level.
   - Increases ascension level (stars) and provides a percentage stat boost. Card level remains max.
   - Max ascension level depends on rarity (SR: 20, UR: 25).

4. Developer Admin Tools:
   - `addCurrencyToUser`: Added functionality to grant gold, diamonds, souls, and a specified amount of *all* elemental shards to a user, updating both Firestore and local SharedPreferences.

5. UI Debugging (CardDetailScreen):
   - Identified "Cannot hit test a render box with no size" and "RenderBox was not laid out: RenderIntrinsicWidth ... size: MISSING" errors.
   - Traced to `AlertDialog` in `_showSacrificeSelectionDialog`.
   - Applied a fix by wrapping the `AlertDialog`'s `content` (a `Column`) in a `SizedBox` with a constrained width.
   - Also wrapped the entire `AlertDialog` in `_showSacrificeSelectionDialog` with a `StatefulBuilder` to ensure the dialog's action buttons rebuild correctly when a sacrifice card is selected.

6. Logging:
   - Modified `_logMessage` in `GameState.dart` to print to the debug console in addition to the in-game battle log, aiding in debugging.

Current Status & Next Steps:
----------------------------
- We were addressing a "FileSystemException: There is not enough space on the disk" error, which is an OS-level issue preventing Flutter from writing temporary build files. This needs to be resolved by freeing up disk space on the C: drive.
- Once the disk space issue is resolved:
    1. Verify if the last UI changes to `card_detail_screen.dart` (constraining `AlertDialog` content width and using `StatefulBuilder` for the dialog) have fixed the "Cannot hit test a render box with no size" layout errors.
    2. Thoroughly test the card ascension flow:
        - Ensure the "Ascend" button on the `CardDetailScreen` enables/disables correctly based on `GameState.canAscend()`.
        - Ensure the "Ascend" button *inside* the `_showSacrificeSelectionDialog` enables correctly after a valid sacrifice card is selected.
        - Confirm that performing an ascension consumes the correct resources and sacrifice card, and that the ascended card's stats and ascension level are updated correctly.
        - Test multiple sequential ascensions on the same card to ensure the logic holds (e.g., going from 1 star to 2 stars, etc.).

Last Log Snippet (Indicating `canAscend` was passing before a potential UI issue or after a hot reload):
I/flutter (30894): !!!!!!!!!! CAN ASCEND METHOD CALLED FOR: Starfire !!!!!!!!!!
I/flutter (30894): [canAscend Check] Passed: All conditions met for Starfire.

Last Error Encountered (before disk space issue):
FileSystemException: writeFrom failed, path = 'C:\Users\nithi\AppData\Local\Temp\flutter_tools.510240cb\flutter_tool.5530619d\app.dill.incremental.dill.sources' (OS Error: There is not enough space on the disk.
, errno = 112)
